        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Ayman Aouinat. I am a 22 year old full stack trainee. I previously graduated from Colorado State University in 2021 and wanted to try my hand at coding since I really enjoy computers and technology.
        I aim to become a full stack web developer in the future. I love collaborating with people and working together to achieve one goal; which is a big part about coding and develpment. Feel free to take a look at my work below!
